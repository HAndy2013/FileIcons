![Before and After](art/before-after.png)

See the [complete list](FileExtensions.md) of supported file extenions.

## Suggest new icons
Though this extension helps to provide missing icons for known file
types, there are still plenty that are missing. To make it super easy
to suggest new icons, there is now a button for that.

![Report missing icon](art/context-menu.png)

Clicking that button will open a GitHub issue so an icon can be added
for that particular file type.

## Language support
For additional language support in Visual Studio, give [Syntax Highlighting Pack](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d92fd742-bab3-4314-b866-50b871d679ee) a try. It adds over 40 new languages to Visual Studio.

## Credit
